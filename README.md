# Predicting-Mobile-Application-Success
Mobile application development is a highly innovative software industry that has turned into an extremely profitable business, with revenues only continuing to rise yearly. Due to immense competition from around the world it is necessary for the app developers to predict the success of their app and whether they are proceeding in the right direction. As most of the apps in the play store are free the revenue generated by the subscriptions, in-app purchases, in-app adverts are practically unknown. The success of an app is usually determined by the user ratings and the number of installs rather than the revenue it generates.

The app features of the apps available google play store are used which are made available on Kaggle. Kaggle provides a rich source of information regarding the apps which includes many attributes such as name, category, review, rating, price etc. Based on the features offered and user reviews of the apps the rating shall be predicted with the help of Python libraries and packages like sklearn, statsmodel, seaborn, matplotlib etc.
